# True History Brewing

## About
This is a website and online storefront I'm currently building for True History Brewing, a brewery and taproom in the west-end of Toronto, Ontario.

## Development
The site is built with React Remix, and uses [Hydrogen](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen) and Oxygen as a headless Shopify storefront, as well as [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) as a headless CMS for non-storefront data ([database repo here](https://github.com/torontopubliclibra/true-history-brewing-data)), and the style is written with SCSS. I wireframed the project using Figma, and am currently in the development process, aiming for a projected launch in early 2024. Please check back soon.

## Setup
### Requirements
- Node.js version 16.14.0 or higher
