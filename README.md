# True History Brewing

## About
This is a website and online storefront I'm currently building for True History Brewing, a brewery and taproom in the west-end of Toronto, Ontario. The site is being built using React, Remix, [Hydrogen](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen), and Oxygen as a headless storefront for use with the Shopify CLI. [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) is also used as a headless CMS ([database repo here](https://github.com/torontopubliclibra/true-history-brewing-data)).

## Development
I wireframed the project myself using Figma, and am in the development process at the moment, aiming for a projected launch in early 2024. Please check back soon.
