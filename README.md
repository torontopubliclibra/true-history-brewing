# True History Brewing

## About
This is a website and online shop for True History Brewing, a brewery and taproom in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It will be launching in late January 2024.

## Development
The website is built with React Remix, and uses [Hydrogen](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen) as a headless Shopify storefront for online orders, and [Strapi](https://strapi.io) as a headless CMS for non-storefront related variable data (hours, events, menus, etc.). You can find the repo for the CMS [here](https://github.com/torontopubliclibra/true-history-brewing-data). The site's custom design was wireframed using Figma, and styled with SCSS.
